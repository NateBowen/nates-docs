## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Notes take from Andrew Makar's YouTube Video

### Non-Functional Requirements

* The properties the product must have.
* Describe the experience the user has while doing their work. These are called out because the customers wants the solution to perform in a certain way.
* Do not alter the products functionality - the functional requirements remain the same no matter what properties you attach to them.
* Can be described by adjectives.
