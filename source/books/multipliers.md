## Overview

The subtitle is, *"How the best leaders make everyone else smarter"*, and I think that's a fair, but incomplete, summary.

Some bullet-point takeaways:

* You are not the superstar - get humble and serve your team

So far (through chapter 4), the book provides a lot of very practical tactics to achieve these ends.

I've also heard the author say in a couple interviews that this book can be summarized as "safety and stretch".
She explains that a good leader will offer some "safe" tasks to their team and some "stretch" tasks to their team.
This is the simplest practical takeaway that echoes the premise of the book, "as a leader - help others grow".

## Chapter 4 - The Challenger

This chapter was very exciting.

The Challenger is contrasted with the Know-It-All leader.

The Know-It-All approaches everything from the perspective that he must have all of the answers.
The rest of the team can't "figure it out" without him.

The Challenger approaches everything from the perspective that he doesn't need to have all of the answers.
In fact, the Challenger's job is to ask bigger, better questions.
He "understands the challenge at a deep enough level to believe a solution is possible".

In the example of Ray Lane at Oracle, the senior executive team was trying to identify the questions and create the right strategy for answering them.
This is interesting, because it sounds exactly like the task for a senior executive team - set the top-level strategy.
However, they were struggling to do this and eventually frustrated their subordinates with confusing presentations.
They found success when they "switched to sharing the fundamental questions, trends, and assumptions that were shaping their views.

The Three Practices of the Challenger

* Seed the Opportunity
  * Show the Need (or let the team discover it)
  * Challenge the Assumptions
  * Reframe Problems
  * Create a Starting Point
* Lay Down a Challenge
