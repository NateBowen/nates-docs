# PM Career Vision Planner

These notes are a walkthrough of the [PM Career Vision Planner](https://productschool.com/product-management-templates/) produced by Product School.
Although the template is presented in the context of Product Management, I think it applies to the wider scope of my career interests.

## Career Highs and Accomplishments

My promotions at DW have been pretty good "highs".
They have always felt like a direct acknowledgement of the quality of my work.
I felt recognized and affirmed.

Participating in the entire lifecycle of the Traeger Link project has been extremely rewarding.
The first time I saw a grill for sale that I helped develop was a major career high.

### What energizes me?

* The pursuit of "winning", knowing there is a major accomplishment to be earned if I work hard enough.
* Solving problems.
* Working with people that I like.

### What makes me feel proud?

* Winning.
* Recognition.
* Knowing I did something that will directly affect other people.
* Seeing my teammates win.

### What kind of activities put me in a state of flow?

* Head-down problem solving.
* Using tools and processes that I like.

## Defining Professional Values

### Who is a professional I admire?

This is an interesting thing to think about.
I think I'm going to limit this to people that I've known personally.

<!-- * Nate Hogan - though I haven't worked with him -->
*Todo*

### Why? Is it their personality, position, achievements, skills? The way they approach problems or lead their team?

*Todo*

### What are behaviors I dislike in the professional space?

* Pride
* Brash/obnoxious attitudes
* Lack of ownership

### Qualities

| Like | Dislike |
| :--- | :------ |
| Can-do attitude | Can't-do attitude |
| Pursuit of excellence | Content with mediocrity |
| Humility | Pride |

### What are the themes in the qualities that I like/dislike?

### Which of these qualities do I want to embody? Which do I want to avoid? Why?

This is a dumb question.
I'd like to embody the things that I like and avoid the things that I don't.

### What is my definition of success?

This probably has different answers for different scopes.

Sometimes there are just individual problems to solve like, "How are we going to get this feature working in time?"
In these cases, success is just solving the problem with as little cost or pain as possible.

For a project that has a finish line, success looks like crossing that finish line in good time while growing having fun along the way.

For a project that doesn't have a finish line, success is just continuous improvement and growth while hitting milestone after milestone.

### What would make my career meaningful?
