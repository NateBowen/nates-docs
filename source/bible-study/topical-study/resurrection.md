# Topic - Resurrection

The topic is "resurrection", but I'm really thinking of all things related to life and death.
Or is that too broad?
I do want to specifically study the concept of literal resurrection from the dead.

For He has torn, but He will heal us;
After two days He will **revive** us;
On the third day He will **raise** us up,
That we may live in His sight."

John 2:18-22
So the Jews answered and said to Him, "What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?"
Jesus answered and said to "Destroy this temple, and in thee days I will **raise** it up."
Then the Jews said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You **raise** it up in three days?"
But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
Therefore, when He had **risen** from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.

John 6:36-40
"But I said to you that you have seen Me and yet do not believe.
All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.
For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me I should lose nothing, but should **raise** it up at the last day.
And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life; and I will **raise** him up at the last day."

* James 5:13-15
Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms.
Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will **raise** him up. And if he as committed sins, he will be forgiven.

* Matt. 17: 6-9

But Jesus came and touched them and said, "**Arise**, and do not be afraid."
When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is **risen** from the dead."

* Matt. 17:22
Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed int the hands of men,
and they will kill Him, and the third day He will be **raised up**."
And they were exceedingly sorrowful.

* Rom. 6:1-14
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?
Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was **raised** from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His **resurrection**,
knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be down away with, that we should no longer slaves of sin.
For he who has died has been freed from sin.
Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
knowing that Christ, having been **raised** from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.
For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that he lives, He lives to God.
Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to seen, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.
And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as beling alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.

John 5:7-15
The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
Jesus said to him, "**Rise**, take up your bed and walk."
And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the Sabbath.
The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."
He answered them, "He who made me well said to me, "Take up your bed and walk."
Then they asked him, "Who is the Man who said to you, "Take up your bed and walk?""
But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place.
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See you have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come up you."
The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.

John 5:19-23
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; fo whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.
For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
For as the Father **raises** the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son **gives life** to whom He will.
For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son, that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father.
He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.

But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will **rise** again."
Martha said to Him, "I know that he will **rise** again in the **resurrection** at the last day."
Jesus said to her, "**I am the resurrection and the life**. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.
And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"
She said to Him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."

* Acts 17:18
* Rom. 6:5

* 1 Cor. 15:12-19
Now if Christ is preached that He has been **raised** from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no **resurrection** of the dead?
But if there is no **resurrection** of the dead, then Christ is not **risen**.
And if Christ is not **risen**, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty.
Yes, and we are found to false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He **raised** up Christ, who He did not **raise** up - if in fact the dead do not **rise**.
For if the dead do not **rise**, then Christ is not **risen**.
And if Christ is not **risen**, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!
Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.

* Phil. 3:7-11
But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ.
Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ
and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;
that I may know Him and the power of His **resurrection**, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,
if, by any means, I may attain to the **resurrection** from the dead.

* Heb. 11:35
Women received their dead **raised** to life again.
Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better **resurrection**.

* Rev. 20:5
