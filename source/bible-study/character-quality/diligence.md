## Word Study

### In the Old Testament

In Ezra 5:8, "with diligence" means "with care"; in Ezra 6:12; Ezra 7:17, "with speed," "speedily"; in Proverbs 4:23 "watchfulness"; in Deuteronomy 4:9; Deuteronomy 6:17; Deuteronomy 19:18 Psalm 77:6 Proverbs 27:23 Isaiah 55:2 Micah 7:3, "with care," "scrupulously," "earnestly." Sometimes it means "early" "with haste" (Job 8:5 Proverbs 8:17). It may mean "industrious," "exacting" (Proverbs 10:4; Proverbs 12:27; Proverbs 22:29).

### In the New Testament

The American revisers have rendered "diligence" for various words in the King James Version, e.g. for "business" in Romans 12:11; "giving diligence" for "endeavoring" (Ephesians 4:3); "give diligence" for "study" (2 Timothy 2:15,), for "labor" (Hebrews 4:11); "diligently" for "carefully" (Philippians 2:28 Hebrews 12:17); "be diligent in" for "meditate upon" (1 Timothy 4:15). It is well also to remember that the Old English meaning of diligence is "with love," from diligo, "to love."
