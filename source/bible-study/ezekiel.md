# Ezekiel

## Chapter 1 - Summary

### Caption

Ezekiel is shown.

### Contents

Ezekiel sees the "likeness of the glory of the LORD".

### Chief People

* Ezekiel
* Four Living Creatures
* God

### Choice Verse

1:28b - "So when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice One speaking."

### Crucial Words

* Likeness
* Whirlwind

### Challenges

The entire vision is very hard to recreate in my mind.
I have no idea what most of the details the Living Creatures really mean.
What is their significance?

And how does the word "likeness" play into all of this.
Is it like the "likeness" in Genesis?
Does it mean that Ezekiel was speaking in metaphor because he couldn't comprehend what he was seeing?
Could there be some of both?

### Cross References

Job 38 - God spoke out of a whirlwind and overwhelms the man he is speaking to.

Rev. 4:7 - The Four Living Creatures are seen.

### Christ Seen

God shows himself on a throne surrounded by brilliance and glory.
It is truly awe-some.

### Central Lessons

* God had not abandoned Israel when He sent them into captivity
* God's supernatural creation is more than we can comprehend

### Conclusion

The mind-breaking descriptions in this chapter add magnificence to my understanding of God.
God is terrifying.
He is truly awesome.
When I am tempted to take God for granted, I will remember this experience that put Ezekiel on the ground.
I am going to teach my children the same.

## Chapter 2 - Summary

### Caption

Ezekiel is called.

### Contents

God tells Ezekiel that he is sending him to be a prophet to Israel.

### Chief People

* Ezekiel
* God

### Choice Verse

```text
"And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words,
though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions;
do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks,
though they are a rebellious house." - Ez. 2:6
```

### Crucial Words

* Rebellious

### Challenges

How do we interpret the account of God telling Ezekiel to eat the scroll?

### Cross References

>He said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you." - Ez. 2:1

> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.
>
> Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?
>
> I am," said Jesus.
>"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven." - Mark 14:61-62

There are lots of cross-references for the phrase, "Son of Man".
This one from Mark is the one that I always remember.

```text
And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that a prophet has been among them. - Ez. 2:5
```

```text
When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place,
they were filled with awe and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!" - Matt. 27:54
```

This is pretty loose, and it might not really be a "cross reference", but there's a parallel event, here.
Jesus was sent to save the lost.
He was scorned and rejected.
But those who were present at the crucifixion knew that a "prophet" had been among them.

### Christ Seen

```text
Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him who spoke to me. - Ez. 2:2
```

The Spirit comes to Ezekiel's aid so that he can obey the command of God.

### Central Lessons

God is serious about obedience.

### Conclusion

God's authority is good and right.
I don't want to live as a "rebel" to His authority.

## Chapter 8 - Summary

### Caption

"Son of Man, See"

### Contents

God shows Ezekiel the abominations of idol worship that are happening in Jerusalem

### Chief People

* Ezekiel
* God
* Elders of Judah

### Choice Verse


### Crucial Words

* Abomination
* Idol
* Jealousy

### Challenges

I do not worship Tammuz, or the Sun, or beasts.
But do I give my heart to other worthless things?
Am I an idolater of comfort?

Another challenge:

This verse is really hard.

>"Therefore I also will act in fury.
>My eye will not spare nor will I have pity;
>and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them." - Ez. 8:18

### Cross References



### Christ Seen

The "likeness" of of God shows up in Ezekiel's face and carries him away in a vision.

>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain. - Ez. 8:4

### Central Lessons

God wants us to be mortified by the acts of idolatry.
He also wants us to see how much patience he has had that he hasn't destroyed his people, yet.

### Conclusion

God is completely aware of our actions, attitudes, and affections.
We hide nothing from him.
He knows if we love him.
He will not share space in our hearts.
