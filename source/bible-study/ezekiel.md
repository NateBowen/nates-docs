### Challenges

The entire vision is very hard to recreate in my mind.
I have no idea what most of the details the Living Creatures really mean.
What is their significance?

And how does the word "likeness" play into all of this.
Is it like the "likeness" in Genesis?
Does it mean that Ezekiel was speaking in metaphor because he couldn't comprehend what he was seeing?
Could there be some of both?

God is terrifying.
He is truly awesome.
When I am tempted to take God for granted, I will remember this experience that put Ezekiel on the ground.
I am going to teach my children the same.
