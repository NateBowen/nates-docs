## Passage

* Psalm 15

## Meditation

What does it mean to "walk uprightly?"
I'd like to be able to answer this simply.

I confess that I have only been sinful in my words, "backbiting with my tongue" towards those who frustrate me.

## Application

I need to guard my thoughts and words more diligently, specifically in regard to grumbling against others.

## Memorization

Lord, who may abide in your tabernacle?
Who may dwell in your holy hill?

He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.
He who does not backbite with his tongue,
Nor does evil to his neighbor,
Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend;

Psalm 15: 1-3
